    <h1>Weight Loss</h1>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>The most important factor in weight loss is your calorie intake. A calorie tracking app is my recommendation to keep yourself accountable.</p>
    <ul>Foods to eat</ul>
    <li>Fruits</li>
    <li>Veggies</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Nuts</li>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>A mix of cardio and strength training is the optimal way to exercise. However, even just walking 30 minutes a day can provide huge benefits. Most important thing is that you listen to your body and find an exercise routine that you can stick to long term.</p>
